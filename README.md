# ScarfKid
Unity-based hobby project.

### What is it?
It's my Unity-learning lab rat.

### Why is it called ScarfKid?
When I started learning Unity, my goal was to create an extremely fluid and smooth action/adventure game where the playable character wears a scarf to show just how smooth he is. That's about it, really.

### I've looked through the repo and I don't see any mention scarves anywhere!
It's a work in progress. I don't know where this project will go, but for the time being, it's my learning playground. I hope I can make the time to complete the project and capture it in it's inspirational glory, but I can't say for sure.

Anyways, thanks for reading!
